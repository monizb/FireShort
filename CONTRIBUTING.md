Now clone the forked repository to your machine. Go to your GitHub account, open
the forked repository, click on the code button and then click the _copy to
clipboard_ icon.

Open a terminal and run the following git command:

```

For example:

```
git clone https://github.com/monizb/FireShort.git
```

where `this-is-you` is your GitHub username. Here you're copying the contents of
the first-contributions repository on GitHub to your computer.

## Create a branch

Change to the repository directory on your computer:

```
cd FireShort
```

Now create a branch using the `git checkout` command:

```
git checkout -b your-new-branch-name

git checkout -b Contributors
```

## Make necessary changes and commit those changes

```
 git add Name of the file you just created or edited
```

see there are changes.

Add those changes to the branch you just created using the `git add` command:

For example:

```
git add Contributors.md
```

Now commit those changes using the `git commit` command:

For example:

```
git commit -m "Added Contributors.md"
```

## Push changes to GitHub

Push your changes using the command `git push`:

```
git push origin your-branch-name
```

replace `your-branch-name` with the name of the branch you created earlier.

## Submit your changes for review

button. Click on that button.
